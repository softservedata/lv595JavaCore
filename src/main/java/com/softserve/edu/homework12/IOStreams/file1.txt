My new File. Here will be information about my career

I'm working for Oil Filed Service provider company named "Schlumberger"
My seniority is 3 yeah.

I mainly work offshore in remote location with great people.

My work involves representing company to external clients, performing a lot hands-on tasks and solving various technical challenges related to well drilling operations.

My job title is Drilling Field Engineer. 

My work required me to travel a lot, so I had opportunity to work in various locations and see different people/cultures.

But now covid ruined it all and I'm stuck in Aberdeen for last 14 month...
